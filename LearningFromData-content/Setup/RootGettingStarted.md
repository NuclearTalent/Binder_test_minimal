# Overview of getting started materials

Appendix C has various materials to set you up for Learning from Data.
You may have the option to run the Jupyter notebooks on a cloud server, but eventually you will likely want to set up an environment on your own machine. You will need to know enough Python to be able to modify the Jupyter notebook (e.g., changing the input parameters) and how to get the notebooks from the [Github repository](https://github.com/NuclearTalent/LFD_development).
* If Python and/or Jupyter notebooks are new to you (or if you need a refresher), you can find a notebook: [Exercise: Jupyter Notebooks and Python](../../LearningFromData-content/Setup/exercise_Intro_01_Jupyter_Python.ipynb) that will take you from zero to just what you need to know about Python and running the Jupyter notebooks in this Jupyter Book (JB).
* For more advanced Python summaries, see the other Python notebooks linked in Appendix C.
* See {ref}`sec:SettingUpJB` for guides to setting up a Python environment on your computer ({ref}`sec:InstallingAnaconda`) and using the Github repository for this JB ({ref}`sec:UsingGithub`).
