::::{admonition} Confidence intervals
:class: my-checkpoint
*Bayesian confidence intervals: how are they defined?* 
:::{admonition} Answer 
:class: dropdown, my-answer
**The Bayesian confidence or credible interval for a parameter with a one-dimenional PDF is defined for a given percentage, call it $\beta\%$. The interval is such that integrating over it one gets $\beta\%$ of the toal area under the PDF. This may not be uniquely defined if the PDF is multimodal or skewed.**

::::{admonition} Point estimates
:class: my-checkpoint
*Various "point estimates" were introduced (mean, mode, median); which is "best" to use?* 
:::{admonition} Answer 
:class: dropdown, my-answer
**A point estimate is a one-number summary of a distribution. Which one is best to use depends on the application. Sometimes one wants to know the most likely case: then use the mode. Sometimes one really wants the average: then use the mean. Sometimes, for an asymmetric distribution, the median is the best estimate. For a symmetric, unimodal PDF, the three point estimates are the same. Note that to a Bayesian, a point estimate is only a rough approximation to the information in the full distribution.**
